# Optimal Switching
this repository contains two version reproducing the results of [Becker, Cheridito and Jetzen's paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume20/18-232/18-232.pdf) about pricing an American Option via Backward Induction.

the repository also includes an extension of these version to the optimal switching problem ("start & stop"), taking as reference the work of [Martyr](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44985404) who gives a discrete-time, finite horizon formulation of the problem that suits the optimal stopping counterpart.
